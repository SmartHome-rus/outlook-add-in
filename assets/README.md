# Asset Files

This directory contains the icon files for the Outlook add-in.

## Required Icons

The following icon files are needed for the add-in to work properly:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon  
- `icon-64.png` - 64x64 pixel icon
- `icon-80.png` - 80x80 pixel icon
- `logo-filled.png` - 90x90 pixel logo for the taskpane

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:

1. Be simple and clear at small sizes
2. Use a consistent color scheme
3. Represent security/scanning functionality (e.g., shield, magnifying glass, etc.)
4. Be saved as PNG files with transparency

For now, placeholder icons are created that will work for testing. Replace them with proper branded icons for production use.
